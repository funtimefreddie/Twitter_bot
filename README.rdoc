Freddie Tamagoochi is a twitter 'bot' who searches for people sending homophobic tweets and sends them a flirty or patronising response.
If they, in turn, respond then he will continue to engage in a conversation with them until they stop - hopefully winding them up in the process
To play along, you can also tweet him suggestions for messages to send using the hashtag #fredflirts.

The main files to update are the seeds file (to add more messages) and the robot.rake file - to control what key words to look for and how often to send and respond to tweets
